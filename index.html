<p>As a little orientation, the floating icons in the top left can be used to navigate to the start, my bio section and the map of my report focuses, as well as send me an email, view my LinkedIn and also my GitHub (where the repository of code related to this site is held) 
  <br>Before you get stuck in, feel free to whack on an audio accompaniment: to the right you can choose a podcast from the odds and pods playlist, some laidback vibes in earlysummer or a mid-century mediterranean party from europicnic

  <h3>About Me</h3>
</div>
<div id="section1" class="main">
  <p>I built this website firstly to learn how to apply <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong> in development, finding out how to do this using YouTube tutorials and examples from around the web. It also serves as a useful tool to illustrate some of the key studies I have undertaken during my university education at:<br>
    <br>The University of Manchester where I am studying for an MSc in Geographical Information Sciences completing the main programme of courses in May 2023.<br>
    <br>The University of Bristol where I studied for a BSc in Geography and graduated in 2021. <br>
    <br>Between Bristol and Manchester I worked for Landmark Information group as a Spatial Data Technician working with a purpose-built GIS API to match addresses to spatial references for an OFGEM contracted project whilst also working as a climbing instructor.<br><br>
    <p>
      Throughout my education I have been fortunate to cover a range of topics, from research and analysis covering global migration and development dynamics and sustainable neighbourhood planning to remote sensing imagery interpretation with multispectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar products and digital terrain model construction using UAV imagery and multi-view stereo methods.
      <br><br>Building confidence and proficiency with GIS applications including QGIS, ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online has been crucial to accessing higher levels of analysis for multiple geographic variables, particularly when using programming outputs generated using the <strong>r and python programming languages</strong> as well as information obtained using <strong>JavaScript with Google Earth Engine and ESA Snap.</strong>
      <br><br>I am currently working on my dissertation exploring geographic natural language processing and looking forward to the first stages in my career as a geospatial scientist.

    <p>Every study offered me the opportunity to add to my existing skillset through development and new learning as well as enhancing my interest and awareness of a range of fields and topics.
      The opportunity to do this through a more holistic international lens made the whole experience more exciting: navigate between each of the points to see the different skills I used, the main subject interest as well as where I covered it. 
<br><br>
      I have provided examples of adaptations to some of my master's work to illustrate some of the theories and practises I have been exploring and enjoying recently. 
<br><br>
      I'm always really excited to talk to people about my work or any opportunities that you might have available. I'd also be more than happy to talk about the resources I used to build this site. <br>
