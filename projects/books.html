    Since starting work after my master's degree I have had a pretty lengthy commute- around 20 hours a week from west London to the Thames Estuary. </br>
    Amongst other things including learning Mandarin, I have been reading novels with a newfound energy and interest. </br>
    In order to direct this energy, I am aiming to read books from across the world to improve my cultural, linguistic, geographical and societal understanding. </br>
    Below I have mapped the books I have read so far in a form of journal to structure my memories of the books I have read so far </br>
